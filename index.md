# Exercise To Use App

**Exercise To Use** helps you build healthy habits by encouraging daily movement before screen time.

When you haven't exercised yet today, the app (with your permission) uses Apple's **FamilyControls / ManagedSettings** framework to temporarily restrict access to selected apps or websites.  
Once you meet your activity goal — or activate a one-day pass if you're not feeling well — access is restored automatically.

### 🩺 Health Data Privacy
- Exercise Lock reads step count, exercise minutes, active energy, and workout data from **HealthKit** only to check whether you’ve exercised today.  
- All Health data is processed **entirely on device** and is **never uploaded** or shared with anyone.

---

### 🔒 Screen Time Usage
- App and website restrictions are applied **only** to items you explicitly select in the system-provided picker.  
- The app cannot and does not lock the entire device.
